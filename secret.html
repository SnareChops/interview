    <h1>Proctor Instructions</h1>
    <p>The point of this evaluation is to see how the candidate handles debugging a malformed data source. The candidate is given the following instructions:</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Available at <span><script>document.write(document.location.origin)</script>/data</span> is a list of fruits.
      Display this list of fruits in an unordered list, sorted alphabetically.</p>
    <p>You are free to use <b>any</b> comfortable language, framework, etc. You may use google, LLMs, StackOverflow, or any other resource you would like as if this were a real task. You are free to ask any questions during the task, and it is recommended to talk through your thought processes.</p>
    <p>Styling is completely optional and not being evaluated in this task</p>
    <p>If you encounter any issues during the task, take us through your debugging processes and use any and all tools and resources.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>The data at this endpoint is malformed and is invalid json (missing a comma). This is intentional and is meant to challenge the candidate to discover and correctly identify the malformed json. Once the candidate has shown competence in debugging this issue and identifying the root cause, supply the candidate with the corrected endpoint <span><script>document.write(document.location.origin)</script>/data/v2</span>. This corrected endpoint should allow them to complete the originally assigned task.</p>
